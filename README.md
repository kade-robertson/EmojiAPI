# EmojiAPI :exclamation:

An utterly useless Emoji API, built on REST principles. :boom:

A demo is available at https://emojis.trade/ for your convenience.

### Why? :question:

A better question -- why not? All of those per-language libraries are such a pain to use in the first place. Why not have a service which can be used the same way in any language? :heart_eyes:

### Usage :information_source:

- `/unicode/:emoji`: Provide a Unicode emoji, and the appropriate emoji code and alias will be returned, if available.
- `/emojicode/:code`: Provide a valid emoji code, and the appropriate Unicode emoji and alias will be returned, if available.
- `/alias/:alias`: provide a valid emoji code alias, and the appropriate Unicode emoji and emoji code will be returned, if available.

All response bodies have the same structure:
```
{
    emojiUnicode: "üòè",
    emojiCode: ":smirking_face:",
    emojiCodeAlias: ":smirk:"
}
```

Any of these values can also be `null` if no corresponding data exists.

### Setting this up :information_source:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Optionally turn on debug more, or change the port in the `api.py` file.
4. `python3 api.py` :snake:

### Footnote

*This is not meant to be taken seriously, this was just my first project doing anything web-development-ish in Python.*
